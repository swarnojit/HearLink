 Once upon a time in a village called Mahabaleshwar, there lived a rich man by name Balvinder Singh. He had the only son by name Yashwant, who was inactive and non-focus towards life. He had no interest in anything, so much that he did not even focus on his studies. All he would do is roam with his friends all the day. Then one day... Son, Yashwant, concentrate on your studies now. You are growing. Don't roam around with your friends all the time. You need to study now. Papa, why do I need to study at all? As we are rich, and should I do a clerical job by studying now? Why are you insisting me to study? Son, Yashwant, knowledge is divine. One should study to become wise, but not to do a clerical job. One should know wise ways to live, and one can get it only through Guru.
